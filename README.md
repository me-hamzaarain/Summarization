# Text Summarization Project

This project demonstrates an example of **automated text summarization** using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## 💡 Overview

The goal is to condense long pieces of text into shorter summaries while preserving the key information. The project may use either:
- **Extractive Summarization**: Selecting key sentences directly from the input.
- **Abstractive Summarization**: Generating novel sentences that convey the original meaning.

## 📁 Files Included

These images illustrate how the summarization model transforms a verbose passage into a concise summary.

## 🛠️ Potential Features (for future implementation)

- Input: Raw text or paragraph
- Output: AI-generated summary
- Backend: Transformer models like BERT, GPT, or T5
- Frontend: Simple UI for input/output display

## 🚀 Use Cases

- Summarizing articles or blogs
- Condensing meeting notes
- Reducing content length for previews or mobile displays
